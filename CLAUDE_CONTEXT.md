# NFL Fantasy Football Prediction System - Development Context

## System Overview

This is a comprehensive NFL fantasy football prediction system with advanced injury intelligence, built using Python, Flask, and machine learning. The system combines 20+ years of historical NFL data with real-time injury reports to generate accurate fantasy predictions.

### Current Status (as of September 2025)
- **Version**: Latest commit `ae1549f` - "Implement comprehensive fantasy football web application with advanced injury intelligence"
- **Production Ready**: Yes, fully functional web application
- **Data Coverage**: 2004-2025 NFL seasons (20+ years)
- **Injury Intelligence**: 28,767 historical records + live ESPN API

## Core Architecture

### Backend Components
1. **Flask Web Application** (`app.py`) - Main web server with RESTful API endpoints
2. **Database Layer** (`src/database.py`) - SQLite database with comprehensive NFL schema
3. **Prediction Engine** (`src/prediction_model.py`) - ML models for player performance prediction
4. **Gameday Predictor** (`src/gameday_predictor.py`) - Orchestrates predictions with injury intelligence
5. **Injury Collector** (`src/collectors/injury_collector.py`) - Multi-source injury data collection
6. **Data Collector** (`src/collectors/nfl_data_collector.py`) - Historical NFL data via nfl-data-py

### Frontend Components
